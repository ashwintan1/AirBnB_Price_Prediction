# AirBnB_Price_Prediction

We apply and evaluate various regression models (Linear, Ridge, Elastic Net, Regression Tree, Random Forest) to a data set   of list prices of AirBnB listings obtained from Kaggle. Joint work with **Netra Pathak** and **Shuhan Xia**. This was our final course project for _STAT 504: Applied Regression_ at the University of Washington, Seattle in Spring 2019.
